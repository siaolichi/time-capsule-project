      People always try to preserve their memory.
      In the past, they use a mural, painting. After the Industrial Revolution, they use photography, the
      sound record. Through the improvement of the Technology, the way people preserve memory
      changed too.

      Time Capsule is also a way to preserve memory. People write what they want to say to their future-
      self in a paper, put the paper into a bottle and buried it. After 10 years, they go back to dig it out to
      see what 10-year-agoâ€™s themselves want to tell themselves in the future. Time changes everything,
      also change a person. Sometimes we want to go back to the past and talks to ourselves. What did
      we change through the time flies? Sometime we can't remember what is the most important thing
      for us 10 years ago. And sometimes we deserve to have a conversation with ourselves in the past.
