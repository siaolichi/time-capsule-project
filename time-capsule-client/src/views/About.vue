    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Li-Chi Hsiao, Studying Art and Media in Berlin University of Art and going to graduate in June 2018.
      I do interactive installations and audiovisual performance in my university program. From 2017, I
      began to create the stand-alone installation which is connected to the internet by Arduino Yun or
      Raspberry Pi. For example, querying data from internet and creating wireless sound control
      system. Since the end of 2017, I began to develop AI and Virtual Reality in my works. I made
      virtual reality audiovisual performance. In the other hand, I do the AI news website. In this website,
      all the photo are taken by a little machine and the news is created by machine learning from those
      photos. Right now, By focusing on Artificial Intelligent and machine learning, I try to have reflection
      the position of humanity in the future between the real world and virtual world.
